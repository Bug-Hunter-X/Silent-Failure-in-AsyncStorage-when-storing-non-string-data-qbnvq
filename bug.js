In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, an uncommon error can occur if you attempt to store a value that is not a string. AsyncStorage only accepts strings.  Attempting to store an object, array, or other data type directly will result in an error, often silently failing or leading to unexpected behavior. This is a common pitfall, as developers might assume AsyncStorage can handle any JSON-serializable data without explicit conversion.
